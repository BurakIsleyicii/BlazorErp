## Contribution Needed

- [ ] Need someone to add in the API Documentation for Swagger.
- [ ] Need someone to implement localization throughout every Razor Component of the solution under the WASM(Client) Project. You can take the Pages/Authentication/Login.razor as the point of reference. It is as simple as adding `@inject Microsoft.Extensions.Localization.IStringLocalizer<Login> localizer` to every page, changing the texts to `@localizer["Text Here"]` and finally adding resx files to the Resources Folder as per the folder structure.
- [ ] Need few contributors to add in various language transalations as per the implemented Location. I got time to only add a few transalations for French as of now.
- [ ] Need a UI contributor to look at the UX/UI of the entire project
- [ ] Need someone to buildup a cool Material Logo for BlazorHero (BH):D Do contact me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/iammukeshm/).
- [ ] And finally, Stars from everyone! :D
